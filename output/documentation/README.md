## Overview

{ "patterns": [ "Configuration Management", "Inheritance" ], "structure": "The code is primarily structured around configuration files that define how third-party services and templates should interact with the project. It does not have a traditional source code structure with directories containing various types of code files.", "modules": { "renovate.json": "Manages dependencies and updates settings. It extends configurations from a central shared repository which allows for easier management and consistency across projects.", ".copier-answers.yml": "Stores the configuration settings used when initially generating the project from a template. It includes metadata like project name, which technologies are used, primary maintainers, and source location for...
